# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

 * Unordered lists, and:
 * More


1. One
2. Two
3. Three

> Blockquote

And **bold**, *italics*, and even yes. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js
var foo = 'bar';
function baz(s) {
   return foo + ':' + s;
}
```

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears

The end ...
